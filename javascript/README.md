# Guess a number in JavaScript

This JavaScript app is a simple guessing game.
It asks you to guess a number between 1 and N,
where N is defined in **config.json**.

If the guess is too high, the app displays "too warm";
if the guess is too low, the app displays "too cold".

The following command starts the app:

`node guess.js`

To quit, enter *q*.
